## Programming Projects:
***1) Table of Student Grades***


Write a Java program that prints a table with a list of at least 5 students together with their grades earned (lab points, bonus points, and the total) in the format below. 

```
///////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
==          Student Points          ==
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\///////////////////


Name            Lab     Bonus   Total
----            ---     -----   -----
Joe             43      7       50
William         50      8       58
Mary Sue        39      10      49
```

The requirements for the program are as follows: 


1. Print the border on the top as illustrated (using the slash and backslash characters). 
2. Use tab characters to get your columns aligned and you must use the + operator both for addition and string concatenation. 
3. Make up your own student names and points—the ones shown are just for illustration purposes. You need 5 names. 




***2) Computing Averages***
The following program reads three integers and prints the average. Fill in the blanks so that it will work correctly. 

```
// *******************************************************************
//   Average.java
//
//   Read three integers from the user and print their average
// *******************************************************************


import java.util.Scanner;
public class Average
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
       int val1, val2, val3;
       double average;
       Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in) ;


       // get three values from user
       System.out.println("Please enter three integers and " +
                       "I will compute their average");


       ____________________________________


       ____________________________________


       ____________________________________


       //compute the average


       ____________________________________


       //print the average


       ____________________________________


    }
}
```
```
Sample Output


Please enter three integers and I will compute their average.
Enter the first value: 5
Enter the second value: 2
Enter the third value: 7
The average is 4.666666666666667.

```
	

***3) Miles to Kilometers ***


Write an application that converts miles to kilometers.(One mile equals 1.60935 km). Read the miles from the user as a floating point value.

***4) Square Calculations***

Write an application that prompts for and reads integer representing the length of a square’s side, then prints the square’s perimeter and area.


***5) Fraction***
Write an application that prompts and reads the numerator and denominator of a fraction as integers and then prints the decimal equivalent of the fraction.
