# ï»¿7 Polymorphism
***Ensure you commit the exercises to GitHub and give the repo and java files sensible names.***


[Example Programs](https://github.com/LBU-OOP/PolymorphismExamples)
# Programming Projects:
***1) Firm Vacation***

Modify the Firm example from the examples such that all employees can be given vacation options depending on their classification/roll. Modify the driver program to demonstrate this new functionality.

***2) Password (PP4)***

Create a class called Password that implements the Encryptable interface from the examples. Then create a main driver that instantiates a Secret object and a Password object, using the same reference variable, and exercise their methods. Use any type of encryption for Password, other than the Caesar cipher used by Secret.
