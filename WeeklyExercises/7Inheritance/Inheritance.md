***Ensure you commit the exercises to GitHub and give the repo and java files sensible names.***


[Example Programs](https://github.com/LBU-OOP/InheritanceExamples)
## Programming Projects:
***1) Hospital***

Design and implement a set of classes that define the employees of a hospital: doctor, nurse, receptionist, cleaner etc. Include methods in each class that are named according to the services provided by that person and that print an appropriate message. 
Eg Nurse <name> Emp# has <x> patients
Doctor <name> Emp# specializes in <specialism>
Cleaner <name> Emp# of <department> is sweeping

Create a driver class to instantiate and test the classes

***1) Player Statistics***

Design and implement a set of classes that keep track of various player sports statistics (PlayerStats). Have a lower level (sub) class that represent specific sports (FootballStats, CricketStats…). Tailor the services of the classes to the sport in question, with common attributes and methods in the higher-level class, as appropriate. Create a driver class to instantiate and text instances of the classes.
