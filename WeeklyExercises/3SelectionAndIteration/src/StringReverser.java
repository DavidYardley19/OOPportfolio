/*
Write a small program that prompts the user for a sentence and then outputs the same sentence with the characters
in each word reversed. For example, if the user enters “This is a sample sentence.”
then the output would be “sihT si a elpmas .ecnetnes.”
Note the use of multiple Scanner objects may be helpful with this program.

public class StringReverser
{
/*
Easy to understand method:
    Write a for loop from the end of the string to the start of the string,
    create a new string where you keep adding the next letter in the for loop. Et voila.
    Is it the most effective, or smallest ammount of code?
        Probably not. There must exists a library that cn already do all that for you.
        TODO: If complete, look into how you can find a library to do all this for you.
        This will assist in one way, however work the "Algorithm" out first.
            Makes me a little sick to call it an algorithm but hey ho.
