Write a small program that prompts the user for a sentence and then outputs the same sentence with the characters
in each word reversed. For example, if the user enters “This is a sample sentence.”
then the output would be “sihT si a elpmas .ecnetnes.”
Note the use of multiple Scanner objects may be helpful with this program.
