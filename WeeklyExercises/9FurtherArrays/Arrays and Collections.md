[Example Programs](https://github.com/LBU-OOP/ArraysExamples)

## Programming Projects:
***1) Histogram***

Design and implement an application that creates a histogram that allows you to visually inspect the frequency distribution of a set of values. The program should read in an arbitrary number of integers that are in the range 1 to 100 inclusive; then it should produce a chart similar to the following one that indicates how many input values fell in the range 1 – 10, 11 – 20, and so on. Print one asterisk for each value entered.

```
1 - 10  | ***
11- 20  | *
21- 30  | *****
31- 40  |
41- 50  | ******
51 -60  | ***
61- 70  | *
71- 80  | *****
81- 90  |
91 -100 | **
```

***2) LL Bank Accounts***

The L&L Bank can handle up to 30 customers who have savings accounts. Design and implement a program that manages the customer accounts. 
* Create an account
* Make a deposit
* Make a withdrawal
Produce appropriate error messages for invalid transactions. Also provide a method to add 3 percent interest to all accounts when ever the method is called.

Create a driver class to test all the methods.


***3) Post Codes***

Design and implement and application that reads a sequence of up to 25 pairs of names and postal codes for individuals. Store the data in an object designed to store a first name, last name and postal code(all as strings). Assume that each line of input will contain three strings, each separated by a tab character. After the input has been read, print the list in an appropriate format to the screen.

***4) Quiz Time***


Define a class called Quiz that manages a set of up to 25 Question objects. Define the add method of the Quiz class to add a question to the quiz. Define the giveQuiz method of the Quiz class to present each question in turn to the user, accept an answer for each one, and keep track of the results. Define a class called QuizTime with a main method that populates a quiz , presents it , and prints the final results
